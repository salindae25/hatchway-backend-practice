# hatchway-backend-practice
Hatchway preview backend question solved

The goal of this practice assessment is to test your backend development skills. The objective is to write a simple JSON API. 

This practice assessment will **not** be graded, however the official assessment will be graded based on the following criteria (so it is good practice to keep these categories in mind while completing this practice assessment):

- Correctness: Is your solution complete and does it pass different test cases?
- Code Organization, Readability, & Maintainability: Is your code easy to read and
well organized?
- Code Performance: Is your code efficient? Did you use appropriate data
structures?
- Best Practices: Did you utilize good programming practices (write unit tests,
avoid anti-patterns)? Did you show a good grasp of your language/framework of
choice?

You can use one of the following programming languages to complete the assessment: **Javascript (NodeJS)**, **Python**, **Ruby**, **Java**, **Go**, or **Rust**. You may use any framework for your language of choice.

Before you tackle the assessment, it may be helpful to review in your language of choice:

1. Creating a simple JSON API

If you have never written a JSON API before, here are a few resources that can help you for different languages:

- Python - **[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/)** (**[Flask JSON API](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-restful-apis-with-python-and-flask/)**)
- Javascript - **[Node + Express](https://medium.com/@onejohi/building-a-simple-rest-api-with-nodejs-and-express-da6273ed7ca9)**
- Java - **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/)** (**[JSON API](https://spring.io/guides/gs/actuator-service/)**)
- Ruby - **[Rails JSON API](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-json-api-with-rails-5-part-one)**

## JSON Recipe File

You can paste the following JSON into a file called `data.json`, and use it as your data source

```json
{
  "recipes": [
    {
      "name": "scrambledEggs",
      "ingredients": [
        "1 tsp oil",
        "2 eggs",
        "salt"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Beat eggs with salt",
        "Heat oil in pan",
        "Add eggs to pan when hot",
        "Gather eggs into curds, remove when cooked",
        "Salt to taste and enjoy"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "garlicPasta",
      "ingredients": [
        "500mL water",
        "100g spaghetti",
        "25mL olive oil",
        "4 cloves garlic",
        "Salt"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Heat garlic in olive oil",
        "Boil water in pot",
        "Add pasta to boiling water",
        "Remove pasta from water and mix with garlic olive oil",
        "Salt to taste and enjoy"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "chai",
      "ingredients": [
        "400mL water",
        "100mL milk",
        "5g chai masala",
        "2 tea bags or 20 g loose tea leaves"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Heat water until 80 C",
        "Add milk, heat until 80 C",
        "Add tea leaves/tea bags, chai masala; mix and steep for 3-4 minutes",
        "Remove mixture from heat; strain and enjoy"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Part 1

Build a GET route that returns all recipe names.

```bash
A GET request to **http://localhost:3000/recipes** returns:
**Response body (JSON):**
{
	"recipeNames":
		[
			"scrambledEggs",
			"garlicPasta",
			"chai"
		]
}
**Status: 200**
```

## Part 2

Build a GET route that takes a recipe name as a **string** param. Return the ingredients and the number of steps in the recipe as JSON

```bash
A GET request to http://localhost:3000/recipes/details/garlicPasta returns:
**If recipe exists:** 
**Response body (JSON):**
{
	"details":
		{
			"ingredients": [
				"500mL water",
				"100g spaghetti",
				"25mL olive oil",
				"4 cloves garlic",
				"Salt"
			],
			"numSteps":5
		}
}
**Status: 200
---
If recipe does NOT exist: 
Response body (JSON)**: {}
**Status**: 200
```

## Part 3

Add a POST route that can add additional recipes in the existing format to the backend with support for the above routes.

```bash
A POST request to **http://localhost:3000/recipes** with body 
{
	"name": "butteredBagel", 
		"ingredients": [
			"1 bagel", 
			"butter"
		], 
	"instructions": [
		"cut the bagel", 
		"spread butter on bagel"
	] 
} 
returns:
**Response body: None**
**Status:** 201
```

Error Response:

If the recipe already exists:

```json
**Response body (JSON):**
{
	"error": "Recipe already exists"
}
**Status: 400**
```

## Part 4

Add a PUT route that can update existing recipes.

```bash
A PUT request to **http://localhost:3000/recipes** with body 
{
	"name": "butteredBagel", 
		"ingredients": [
			"1 bagel", 
			"2 tbsp butter"
		], 
	"instructions": [
		"cut the bagel", 
		"spread butter on bagel"
	] 
} returns:
**Response body: None**
**Status:** 204
```

Error Response:

If the recipe doesn't exist:

```json
**Response body (JSON):**
{
	"error": "Recipe does not exist"
}
**Status: 404**
```
